Circle Generation Algorithm Summary

This Python function creates ASCII art circles by determining which positions in a text grid fall within a specified radius using mathematical calculations. The algorithm generates a square grid of size (2×radius + 1) where each cell represents either the interior ('#') or exterior (' ') of a circle.

Core Mathematics:

Uses the Euclidean distance formula: √(dx² + dy²)

Applies the circle equation: (x-center_x)² + (y-center_y)² ≤ radius²

Centers the circle at (radius, radius) for perfect symmetry

Key Features:

Creates filled circles (disks) rather than outlines

Maintains smooth circular boundaries using precise distance calculations

Handles edge cases: negative radii (empty output), zero radius (single newline)

Produces consistent, mathematically accurate results across all radii

Applications:

Terminal-based graphics and visualizations

Educational demonstrations of geometric principles

Text-based user interfaces

Simple graphic rendering in constrained environments
